1. read some basic shit about SemanticSegmentation

classification -> localization -> semantic segmentation
AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet
Semantic Segmentation can be thought of as an encoder network followed by a decoder network. Encoder is a pre-trained classificator network. Decoder: project discriminative features learnt by the encoder onto the pixel space.
3 main approaches for decoding:
	1. region base semantic segmentation: R-CNN extracts large quantity of 	object proposals and then computes CNN features for each of them. Then 	classifies.
	2. fully convolutional network based semantic segmentation (FCN): predictions are in low resolution
	3. Weakly supervised semantic segmenation: manually labeling is expensive. 
FCN is most popular.

Taglal egy csomó jó cikket az újításaikkal együtt +
semantic segmentation is understanding an image at pixel level -> assign each pixel in the image an object class "dense pixel-wise predictions from our models"
VOC dataset, MSCOCO dataset
VOC - Visual Objects Classes

2. decide between project/comparative article approach (sum comparative shit I would be ideal)
